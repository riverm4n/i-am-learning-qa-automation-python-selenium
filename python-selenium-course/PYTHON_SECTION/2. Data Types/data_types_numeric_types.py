# Ok so on day two and class 13 I am getting somewhat lazy because come on... Even though I have not programmed in quite
# a while, I really don't need to re-learn Data Types... Python was the language that I learned how to program at the
# discipline of "Introduction to Computer Science" and then I learned all of the programming paradigms on this language
# later on
